%auto_scale_it_v1p2
%
%Summary:
%Loads in a set of images (developed for TEM images) within a directory
%Calculating the length, width and aspect ratio of rod like structures
%for every image in a directory
%plotting a histogram for the length, width and aspect ratio
%Note: v1p2 now inlcudes better scaled histograms
% v1p2p1 adds images of the intermediate stages of every image in the folder
%
% v1p3 - removes 2 pixels from length and width (as previously overestimates by 1 pixel on each side)
% 	- and fixed scaling issue in the intermediate stages images
% 	also:
% 	-changes criteria for objects:
% 		- added criteria of width greater than 5nm
% 		- changed min length to 15nm (from 10nm)
% 		- changed min eccentricity to 0.7 (from 0.6)
% 		- added max length of 70nm
% 		- changed max width to 25nm (from 200 pix)
%
%v_1 reads in dm3 files only (which contains the scale factor for pixels
%to nm in it) -- for other file formats either amend code or contact David
%Harris-Birtill (birtil@hotmail.com)
%
%
%How to use:
%- Before running move all the data you want to analyse into a folder with
%only those dm3 data files in (this code assumes only dm3 files are in
%this directory)
%- run this script (type: auto_scale_it_v1 into matlab when in this
%directory)
%- select your data folder
%- select the folder you would like to have the figures saved to
%- let it run (normally takes approx. 3 secs per image, therefore 20 images
%takes 1 min)
%- The histrograms will be plotted and displayed on your screen and
%automatically saved to the specified folder.
%
%
%Note: if the instrument is changed or the background level of the images
%changes then the threshold value (at top of this script) should be
%modified.
%
%
%Description of analysis of each image:
%- The image loaded in and the scale factors loaded (also converts scale to
%always be in nm (converts µm to nm)
%- The image is then thresholded, settng all values above a level to equal
%that level
%- The gradient of the thresholded image is taken in each direction
%the absolute of these matrixices are made (flipping -ve to +ve)
%- The sum of the gradient maps is taken (This provides high intensity at
%the edges of objects all around the object)
%- The this gradient map is converted into a binary image (0&1)
%- An edge detection algorithm (Roberts method) is used on this binary map
%to find the edges of the objects
%- a watershed algorithm is used to segment the image into many objects
%- The length, width, area and eccentricity of these objects is measured
%- for each object the length and width are recorded if the below criteria
%for are satisfied for that object:
%-- The eccentricity is greater than 0.6 (this means it wont look at spheres only rods)
%-- The area is greater than 30 pixels (removes noise objects)
%-- The width is less than 200 pixels (removes crazy wide objects)
%-- The length is greater than 10nm (again removes unwanted tiny objects)
%-- The object does not touch the image border <<- first included in v1p1
%
%-The length and widths are converted from picels to nm using the loaded
%scale factors
%- Then the aspect ratio is calculated by dividing the length by the width
%
%Every image in the directory is loaded and analysed in this way and the
%values are recorded by appending arrays (creating a long table which
%includes all values for every image in one long list).
%
%Then histograms are plotted for the length, width and aspect ratio using
%the data from every image in the folder
%these histograms are saved into the folder specified by the user at run
%time
